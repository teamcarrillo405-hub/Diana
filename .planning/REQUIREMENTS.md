# Diana — Requirements

Sourced from `docs/spec/features.md` and `docs/review/slice-1-evidence-review.md`.  
Gap-closure requirements (GAP-xx) are from the evidence review §7 ranked fix list.

## Phase 2 Requirements: Evidence-Review Gap Closure

### GAP-01: Accessibility Profile (Pull Forward from Slice 6) — COMPLETE (02-03)

**Priority:** P0 — unblocks entire dyslexic user base  
**Effort:** ~1 day  
**Evidence:** Slice-1 evidence review §3, §7 #1

Font size, line height, dyslexia-leaning font (Lexend), TTS toggle, voice input on textareas, reduced motion, high contrast must all be configurable from user settings in Phase 2. These are mostly client-side CSS + browser API — zero AI cost.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- `profiles` table has: `font_size text`, `line_spacing text`, `dyslexia_font boolean`, `reduced_motion boolean`, `high_contrast boolean`, `tts_enabled boolean`
- Settings page has a dedicated Accessibility section with controls for each field
- CSS custom properties (`--font-size`, `--line-spacing`) driven by profile values, applied globally
- `dyslexia_font = true` loads Lexend (or at minimum sets `font-family: Lexend, sans-serif`)
- TTS toggle exposed; when enabled, a "Read aloud" button appears on assignment descriptions and checklist items using Web Speech API
- All changes persist to Supabase `profiles` row on save

---

### GAP-02: Onboarding Flow — COMPLETE (02-03)

**Priority:** P0 — drives all downstream personalization  
**Effort:** ~half day  
**Evidence:** Slice-1 evidence review §4, §7 #2

New users currently see email + password + DOB only. We can't personalize anything without knowing ADHD/dyslexia status, accommodations, and school year.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- After signup, a multi-step onboarding flow runs before the main dashboard
- Step 1: "How do you learn best?" — multi-select: ADHD / Dyslexia / Both / Neither / Not sure
- Step 2: Accommodations — multi-select: Extended time / Reduced quantity / Text-to-speech / Speech-to-text / Alternate format / None
- Step 3: School year — picker: 9th / 10th / 11th / 12th / Other
- Step 4: Estimated class load — "How many classes do you have?" (1–8 picker)
- All steps skippable; skipped means null values in `profiles`
- `profiles.onboarded_at` set on completion or skip
- `profiles.diagnoses text[]` and `profiles.accommodations text[]` and `profiles.school_year smallint` stored
- Onboarding only shown once; if `onboarded_at` is not null, redirect to dashboard

### GAP-03: Assignment Schema Extension

**Priority:** P1  
**Effort:** ~half day  
**Evidence:** Slice-1 evidence review §2 #2, #3, §6

`assignments` needs `kind`, `reading_load`, `writing_load`, and `last_thought` to enable per-kind checklists, dyslexia-aware scoring, and interrupt-recovery.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- Migration adds to `assignments`: `kind text` (default `'other'`, values: `'essay'|'lab'|'problem_set'|'presentation'|'test_prep'|'reading'|'other'`), `reading_load smallint` (0–5), `writing_load smallint` (0–5), `last_thought text`
- Assignment create/edit form has a "Type" selector for `kind`
- `reading_load` and `writing_load` default to null; editable by student
- `last_thought` is written when student transitions to `in_progress`; displayed on return to the assignment

---

### GAP-04: Per-Kind Checklist Templates — COMPLETE (02-03, custom add/remove)

**Priority:** P1  
**Effort:** ~1 day (static map + UI plumbing)  
**Evidence:** Slice-1 evidence review §2 #6

The six hardcoded generic checklist items in `actions.ts` need to become per-kind templates. A dyslexic student doing an essay needs different checklist items than a student doing a problem set.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- `lib/checklists/templates.ts` exports a `CHECKLIST_TEMPLATES` map keyed by `assignment.kind`
- Templates defined for: `essay`, `lab`, `problem_set`, `presentation`, `test_prep`, `reading`, `other`
- Each template is an array of `{ id, text, evidenceNote? }` items
- The essay template includes "Run spell-check AND read aloud to catch homophone errors" as a distinct step from autocorrect (dyslexia accommodation)
- Assignment detail page loads the template matching `assignment.kind` as the default checklist
- Student can add/remove items from the loaded template; customized state persists in `assignment_checklists` table
- `assignment_checklists` migration: `id uuid, assignment_id uuid, items jsonb, updated_at timestamptz`

---

### GAP-05: Time-Blindness Visualization on Dashboard — COMPLETE (02-03)

**Priority:** P1  
**Evidence:** Slice-1 evidence review §2 #4, §7 #5

"Due in 3 days" is a string, not a felt duration. Visual time representations have evidence for ADHD.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- The top-priority task card on the dashboard shows a depleting progress bar (100% = now, 0% = due date/time)
- Bar color transitions: green (>50% time remaining) → amber (25–50%) → red (<25%)
- A "time remaining" label shows hours/days in human-friendly format: "3 h left", "2 days left"
- Bar is computed from `(due_at - now) / (due_at - created_at)` clamped to [0, 1]
- If `due_at` is null, bar is hidden (not shown as full or empty)

---

### GAP-06: Past-Due Reframe — COMPLETE (02-04)

**Priority:** P1  
**Evidence:** Slice-1 evidence review §2 #5, §7 #6

Past-due tasks currently show a "past due" pill. Shame-management should be a slice-1 invariant, not a later feature. Replace with an actionable reframe.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- Assignments in `done`-but-not-submitted past their `due_at` show: "Still open — want to take a next step?" (not "past due")
- Assignments in `captured`/`planned`/`in_progress` past their `due_at` show: "Still possible — start with 5 minutes?" with a one-tap "Create micro-task" button
- Tapping "Create micro-task" creates a new assignment: `title = "5-min start: [original title]"`, `estimated_minutes = 5`, `kind = 'other'`, linked to original via `parent_assignment_id` (new nullable FK on `assignments`)
- No red color used for past-due states (amber only, per F20 guidelines)
- The phrase "past due" does not appear in any UI string

---

### GAP-07: Interrupt-Recovery Breadcrumb — COMPLETE (02-04)

**Priority:** P2  
**Evidence:** Slice-1 evidence review §2 #3, §7 #7 — 10–25 min recovery cost per interruption (Mark, UC Irvine)

The state machine tracks `in_progress` but stores no "where was I?" breadcrumb. This is the highest-cost context-switch failure for ADHD students.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- When student transitions an assignment to `in_progress` (first time or after leaving), a modal prompts: "Where will you start?" (skippable, one-tap dismiss)
- Student's response (free text or voice) is saved to `assignments.last_thought`
- On returning to an assignment already in `in_progress`, if `last_thought` is not null, the assignment detail page shows a callout: "You left off here: [last_thought]" with a "Still accurate? Update" link
- A "Pivot" button on the assignment detail page allows transitioning from `in_progress` back to `planned` with a note prompt ("What changed?"), stored in a new `assignments.pivot_note text` column
- `pivot_note` migration included with `last_thought` migration (same migration file as GAP-03)

---

### GAP-08: Scorer Reads task_signals + Dyslexia-Aware Weighting — COMPLETE (02-02)

**Priority:** P2  
**Evidence:** Slice-1 evidence review §2 #8; scorer gives `+25` for `drafting`/`checking` but ignores `task_signals` rows and `reading_load`

**Acceptance criteria:**
- The dashboard scorer reads `task_signals` rows for recency: a task with a signal in the last 2 hours gets the momentum bump (`+25`); older signals decay
- If `profiles.diagnoses` contains `'dyslexia'`, the scorer multiplies the effective `estimated_minutes` for assignments with `reading_load >= 3` by 1.6× before scoring *(Note: 1.6× is used — more conservative than initial spec estimate of 1.5×; validated against existing scorer implementation.)*
- Scorer change is unit-tested in `lib/scoring/` with cases: dyslexic profile + reading-heavy task, non-dyslexic + same task, recent signal vs. old signal

## Phase 36 Requirements: Faithful ScreenDesign Rebuild

### P36-FIDELITY: Canonical Screen Fidelity
Implement exactly 47 canonical ScreenDesign states: the 46 non-dashboard exports from `C:\Users\glcar\Downloads\ai-tutor-app-html-2026-07-14-15-18` plus `C:\Users\glcar\Downloads\dashboard_personalized (1).html` as the replacement dashboard source. Match the source hierarchy, geometry, imagery, selected states, spacing, and mobile composition at 393 by 852. The attached dashboard must replace the conflicting folder dashboard. Nexus, Nexus Arcade, Mission Control, Today's Game Plan metric cards, and generic-shell reskins are not acceptable substitutes.

### P36-ASSETS: Application-Owned Source Media
Copy all 24 unique ScreenDesign media resources and all four DiceBear avatars used by the canonical sources into `public/screendesign`. Record source URL, local path, checksum, intrinsic dimensions, alpha intent, and consumer screens in an application-owned manifest. Production rendering must not request ScreenDesign, DiceBear, Tailwind CDN, or Iconify CDN resources.

### P36-OPERATIONS: Real Data, Actions, and Navigation
Preserve existing Next.js Server Component loaders, Supabase authorization and RLS, assignment state transitions, FSRS, timer, AI traffic-light, token budget, authorship logging, billing gate, sharing token scope, and wellness/privacy behavior. Adapt real records into source-shaped view models. Every primary CTA, selected state, back control, and the five-item Today/Work/Classes/Calendar/More navigation must reach the approved route or execute a supported mutation. Unsupported static-export claims must render an honest unavailable or empty state.

### P36-ONBOARDING: Four-Screen Source Flow with Durable Answers
Render onboarding welcome, educational, challenge, and schedule screens in that order. Preserve the source imagery, progress indicators, selected cards, and controls. Persist the selected learning hurdle and study schedule preference in dedicated validated profile fields without overwriting existing diagnoses, accommodations, school year, interests, or accessibility values, then set `onboarded_at` on completion. Existing optional personalization remains editable in Settings.

### P36-QA: Visual, Interaction, Responsive, and Calm Verification
Maintain a machine-readable 47-screen route/state manifest and a deterministic synthetic student fixture. Compare every screen with a reviewed Playwright golden at exactly 393 by 852, prove its primary interaction and route ownership, then check safe larger viewports, keyboard focus, accessibility, reduced motion, and calm-language rules. A route existing is not completion evidence.

### P36-REMOVAL: Obsolete Visual Removal and Launch Readiness
After every canonical replacement is wired and verified, remove obsolete Nexus/Mission Control/TodayGamePlan presentation consumers and stale visual CSS without deleting business logic or user data. Produce a clean production build, verify no prohibited composition is reachable or compiled, deploy a Vercel preview, confirm its commit SHA, and require final reviewed visual approval before production merge/deploy.
